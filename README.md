# GoLang Algorithm Studies

This repository was created to organize and share studies related to algorithms implemented in the GoLang programming language. It contains examples of classic algorithms, organized by type, focusing on learning and best programming practices.

## Repository Structure

Below is the current organization of the directories and the algorithms included:

```
/
|-- binary-search/         # Implementation of the binary search algorithm
|-- quick-sort/            # Implementation of the quick sort algorithm
|-- recursive/             # Recursive algorithms
    |-- count/             # Recursive algorithm for counting
    |-- higher/            # Find the maximum value in a list recursively
    |-- sum/               # Recursive sum of the elements in a list
```
